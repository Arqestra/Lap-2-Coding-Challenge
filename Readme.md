# Assignment 1

## Installation and Usage

### Installation
    - Clone the Repo
    - cd into 'Lap-2-Coding-Challenge' folder
    - If docker does not run properly, considering using 'npm install'
    
### Usage
    - Use 'bash ./_scripts/start.sh' to run the server and api
    - Use 'localhost:8080' in your browser to access the website!
    - Use 'bash ./_scripts/stop.sh' to stop the server
    - Use 'bash ./_scripts/teardown.sh' to remove all volumes

## Changelog

### SQL
    - Added data types for the title, name, content
    - Setup the database schema

### Routes
    - Added routes for each of the actions in controllers

### Controllers 
    - Added a controller for the model

### Models
    - Added a model for the SQL database

## Bugs
    - Currently nothing works because the api isn't displaying our seeded data
    - Therefore, it doesn't appear to be connecting which must be due to a formatting issue

## Wins and Challenges
    - A good attempt at trying to connect an API to a database while storing this data from the user's input in the website
    - Found it very difficult to get the API to work correctly
